<p class="secondp">
    A pet, or companion animal, is an animal
     kept primarily for a person's company or 
     entertainment rather than as a working animal, 
     livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular
     pets are often considered to have attractive 
     appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, 
     but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis 
     (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner 
     regardless of these characteristics.
